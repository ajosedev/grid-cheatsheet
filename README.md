# CSS Grid Cheatsheet
A visual cheatsheet to help you remember CSS Grid.  
Uses shorthand syntax wherever possible, to keep things as small and as concise as possible.  

May be broken in IE11, due to the grid implementation.

## Why?
- As an introduction to [gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) for static sites
- A playground for learning [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) with composition
- To always be practicing design

**Suggestions welcome!**
